# Social_Analytics:

In this project I am utilizing Social Media to gather and analyze data. I have chosen one of the most powerful social media channels currently, TWITTER! Gathering people’s tweets and using Vader Sentiment Analysis to analyze sentiments expressed by Twitter users with these five massive media organizations:

•	BBC;

•	CBS;

•	CNN;

•	Fox;

•	New York Time.

One of the important aspects to use social media mining is that you can gather the most updated information, in this case, tweets; that way the visualizations are up to date to any particular trend.
While analyzing the last 100 most recent tweets from each organization, we realize that the majority of these tweets have a neutral feedback. However, when analyzing the overall feedback, CNN and Fox have an overall negative feedback from followers; while BBC, CBS and New York Times have a positive overall feedback.
